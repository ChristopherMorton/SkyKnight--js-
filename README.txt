This is a puzzle game in which the titular Sky Knight traverses grid-based dungeons in the sky.  The Knight can jump as a knight in chess, fire arrows up/down/left/right, and push certain objects that are orthoganally adjacent.

Included in this repository are the file SkyKnight.js that contains all the game code, a home.php that runs it (identical to the one hosted at www.cgmorton.com/holygophergames/skyknight), and the various images and sounds required to play.

SkyKnight.js currently relies on jQuery, so load that first if you want to host it.
